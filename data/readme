I only include a (small) portion of data used
I do not include data like MERRA-2 that can be readily downloaded
I include data like he deltamat to (e.g.,) generate Q; biome map.

biome.mat is 46 by 72. 
landmap.mat 0 for ocean, 1 for land, 2 for ice.
area45.mat is 46 by 72 in km^2.


ocean fluxes data are montly from Jan-2015 to Dec-2017, from EDDC, in unit of umol/m2/s.
